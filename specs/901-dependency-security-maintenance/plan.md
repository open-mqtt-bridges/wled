# Implementation plan

## Technical context

Base: `main` at `2994b985841dcb826cd935be59e021c68b348552`. Checkout: `35-dependency-security-maintenance`. Package manager: `pnpm@11.28.9`. Follow `docs/development.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, organization `CONTRIBUTING.md` and effective lint/format/type configuration. User approved all eleven implementation issues after their links were shown.

## Design and constitution check

No public API/schema/data-model changes. Compatibility, ownership, credential protection, documentation and verification principles apply. Update coupled runtime/framework packages together, then independently review tooling/documentation and native groups. NestJS target: 12.4.2; website Nuxt: 4.6.4 and @nuxt/eslint: 1.17.0. Other stable targets come from authoritative registry/action metadata at execution time. Preserve aliases, patches and trust settings unless a verified compatible replacement is required. Do not force TypeScript 7 across incompatible peers.

## Delivery

T1 records baseline/targets; T2 verifies security settings and scanner configuration; T3 remediates audits; T4 applies compatible updates and validates each group; T5 runs integration checks, repeats audits and opens a consolidated PR. Tasks are tracked in `tasks.md` and the linked issue; implementation groups receive tested commits. Existing Dependabot PRs remain open and are linked as superseded where applicable. Release PRs remain untouched.

## Validation

Use documented local checks, clean immutable installs, relevant container/health checks and post-update audits. Rust requires format, Clippy, tests and release build plus RustSec. Website requires browser/mobile/keyboard verification. Existing failures and external limitations remain explicit. Details and actual results are recorded in `audit.md`.
